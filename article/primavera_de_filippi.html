            When OpenAI gave a selected group of artists early access to Sora, its new text-to-video technology, it framed it as an exclusive opportunity for them to experiment with a new creative tool. Yet, beneath this allegedly generous gesture lies an unspoken bargain: artists' expertise and creativity are harnessed as free labor to refine and validate OpenAI's product. In truth, the early access to Sora should rather be framed as unpaid consultancy, where artists' feedback and creations become an integral part of the product's evolution, contributing to OpenAI long-term profits without obtaining a penny in return.

This practice is indicative of a deeper form of systemic exploitation that has plagued the creative industries for centuries: the commodification of creativity without compensation. What makes it more insidious in the digital realm is the ease by which unpaid labor is being harvested for private gains by large corporations, under the disguise of experimentation, collaboration, and community contribution.

Major online social media platforms like X/Twitter and Facebook, as well as large online operators like Google have long perfected the art of harvesting user-generated content to generate profits, framing participation as empowerment while systematically appropriating the value created by their user base. The same logic now infiltrates the realm of AI, where artists are invited to "collaborate" on tools like Sora —not as equal partners but as unpaid beta testers— while their works are being mined to refine algorithms that will one day compete against them.

The 300 artists who were part of the Sora trial experienced radically different levels of engagement and compensation. While a selected few received substantial commissions (with some artists securing funding in the 5 figure range for Sora-based projects), the majority were offered minimal or no financial recognition. The carrot was dangled for a small prize of USD $1500, plus a screening opportunity, for those who produced the most outstanding works —according to OpenAI's standards.

Accordingly, only artists producing works that implicitly glorify the product, highlighting Sora's capabilities rather than challenging its limitations, were positioned to receive meaningful financial support. The unspoken mandate of these artists, competing for corporate recognition, is to generate PR-friendly content that best aligns with OpenAI's publicity and marketing objectives. Bold experimentation, critical engagement, or works that push against the traditional aesthetics seldom earn recognition and are systematically marginalized in a system designed to prioritize commodified aesthetics over genuine artistic exploration. This dynamic doesn't just constrain creativity; it co-opts it, converting artists into de facto brand ambassadors for a tool that ultimately profit from their labor and ideas.

The uneven landscape of opportunity revealed by the Sora trial is no accident—it's a strategic corporate maneuver. By selectively curating participation, OpenAI crafts the illusion of inclusivity and support for the arts, masking a system where only those who align with its marketing narrative reap substantial rewards. Even seemingly generous funding becomes a sophisticated form of control, binding well-paid artists to corporate interests and framing their work as a showcase of the tool's prowess rather than a genuine exploration of its possibilities.

Meanwhile, unpaid artists are left to labor in precarious conditions, chasing the vague promise of recognition. Their creative energy is effectively weaponized, compelling them to conform to corporate whims and produce works that align with predetermined aesthetics in the hope of securing some degree of acknowledgment or compensation. This dynamic not only reinforces the imbalance of power but also perpetuates a system where artistic innovation is commodified, creativity is co-opted, and dissenting voices are pushed to the margins. Eventually, this might nurture a system where corporations are the ones that dictate the terms of artistic innovation, with artists acting as mere cogs in the machine of algorithmic refinement.

Indeed, the corporations that train generative AI models are those who ultimately dictate the creative capabilities of these models. This illustrates an even more insidious problem that goes well beyond artistic exploitation: the potential loss of artistic diversity. Sora, just like many of the other corporate generative AI models are trained on datasets built around safe, marketable aesthetics, with a view to generate content that is both popular and profitable. This produces tools that flatten creativity and preclude artistic innovation, turning art into an algorithmic echo chamber that rewards imitation over imagination.

Artists are thus forced to grapple with a paradox: the very tools intended to "empower" them are also stripping them of their artistic individuality, boxing them into a recursive cycle of homogenization and self-reproduction operated under corporate terms. This inevitably results in a progressive erosion of artistic agency in the face of corporate interests.

How can we reverse this trend?

What artists need is not a "cage with a view" but a real seat at the table. Corporations like OpenAI must recognize that real partnerships with artists entails more than mere visibility or early access to technology. For artists to act as true collaborators in shaping the future of generative AI, not only must they be given access to new creative tools, they must also be trusted with participatory governance and equitable compensation for the use and refinement of these tools.

Ultimately, the point is not only to reprimand artistic exploitation—it's about reclaiming the ability for artists to shape the tools that will drive the future of artistic innovation. For if we let corporations define the purpose and usage of these tools, we risk losing the very essence of artistic expression: its diversity, defiance, and dissent, along with its capacity to constantly challenge and reimagine the world.

In this light, the artists who subverted OpenAI's access restrictions by providing public access to Sora through their own key staged a provocative and deeply symbolic artistic performance. By breaking the corporate restrictions and allowing anyone to make use of this innovative tool, they illuminated the power of creative resistance to reclaim agency and transform the narrative of technology into one of empowerment, not exploitation. It was a bold reminder that art, at its core, is an act of defiance—one that refuses to be caged.
