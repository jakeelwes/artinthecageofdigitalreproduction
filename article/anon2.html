            It is important to have a more nuanced conversation about art and corporations. While I enjoyed playing with Sora and did not feel pressured into doing “free labor” in terms of tests or feedback, I realized, as an artist, I’m just a pawn in a bigger game. A PR game in which artists’ role in the program is not crafting their own narratives, critiquing the tools or exploring the shortcomings. It’s a game with an unspoken set of rules where as an alpha artist your ultimate goal is showcasing the product’s best capabilities and such are awarded. Visually easily digestible content, silently glorifying Sora’s capabilities is what (unsurprisingly) gets rewarded.
